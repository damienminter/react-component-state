Taking a look into the differnt ways to manage state across FUNCTIONAL components using React HOOKS

I have split the differnt ways into branches

BRANCHES
1. Basic Prop Drilling (Lifting state up with props)
2. Spread Prop Drilling (Lifting up state while using the spread operator to drill through props {...props})
3. Spread & Rest Prop Drilling (Using spread and rest operator to perform an additional state update midway thorugh the component tree)
4. Composition with React Children (Refactoring the code to use compositon and Reacts children prop to avoid passing state through components
5. useContext Hook (Refactoring the code to use the context hook to avoid prop drilling and sharing state across components)

Master (ignore - init only)
